# Classification-of-brazilian-coin-dataset


Acording to author of brazilian-coin-dataset, This dataset is a collection of images and their respective labels containing examples of multiple Brazilian coins, the primary purpose is to support the development of Computer Vision techniques for automatic detection of such objects, i.e., localization and classification tasks. In addition, It contains coins of R$ 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 in Brazilian currency.


In this project, a CNN architecture presented in order to classify each of coin images to pre-known labels. First, by using Image processing techniques, coin was captured in any given Image and then, it fed to CNN and finally it classified.


the whole project developed in Keras framework.
